# uploader

This is a very dumb tool, that is very (IMHO) handy. It's for sharing
files between two computers very easilly.

I got really annoyed when I just wanted to share some files with
people over a local network and found that there was no
straightforward way between Linux and Windows. Also not everyone has
the similar tools that you use.

So I thought of writing a simple golang http uploader, where you can
easilly pass files between computers on a local network.

It worked.

## Disclaimers

This is not very secure. Maybe I'll iterate over it in the future, but
not now. The main concern for this software, is to give you a quick
and practical way to share files over local networks, by simply
sharing a single binary.
